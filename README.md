# form-a-story

### **Description:**
This is fun 'Mad Libs' style application meant for entertaining kids. It allows them to input their own personalized verbs, adjectives, animals etc. and create their own fictional story. The app focuses on the proper use of HTML forms, including various input types and buttons, input validation and data utilization using JavaScript logic in order to personally customize a story. The form will also save information previously typed in by the user for later use so they can mix and match elements of the resulting story. As of now, there is only 1 baseline story in which the input is injected into. Future development features would include multiple stories stored as JavaScript Objects which would be chosen at random each time a story form is completed.
